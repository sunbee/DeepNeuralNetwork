# Deep Neural Network Prototype
## This notebook presents the development of a deep neural network, i.e. a neural network with more than one hidden layer.

What to use his notebook for:
- Implement back-propagation "by hand" in the general case of multiple hidden layers with various activation functions.
- Test out the system architecture with one pass forward and backward, with functions for 
  - forward progagation with relu and sigmoid activations
  - loss computation by cross-entropy
  - back-progagation to update parameters by gradient descent
- Prepare the building blocks for future applications.
