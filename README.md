# Deep Neural Network Prototype
## This notebook presents the development of a deep neural network, i.e. a neural network with more than one hidden layer. \

What to uset his notebook for:
- Implement back-propagation "by hand" in the general case of multiple hidden layers with a choice of activation functions.
- Test out the system architecture with one pass, consisting of functions for 
-- forward progagation with relu and sigmoid
-- loss computation with cross-entropy
-- back-progagation to update parameters by gradient descent.
